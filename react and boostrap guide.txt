How to install boostrap react
-----------------------------

download boostrap source files
(alpha)
go into the dist folder and copy 
 * bootstrap.css or 
 * bootstrap.min.css

 * drop it in the publi/css folder
	(create it if is not)
 
 * link it in html href=css/boostrap.css 
(this might result in 404 so css.map is not loaded
find loader for css.map)
------------------------------------
installing sass is  a bit different 

* npm installl --save bootstrap v4.0.0-alpha.6

Currently v4.0.0-alpha.6 is the latest
the scss folder is now avalible in the node modules
with all the components we need.

rename app.css to app.scss, and inside
define import line two levels up

 * @import '../node modules/bootstrpa/scss/bootstrap'

the file bootstrap.scss has all the universal uses fot the 
package, it impost a bunch of stuff
the core is almost everything all the components or mudules
utilities might not be needed

u can import the variable the core and the parts we need.

so that is a diff thing, here we have imported everything in 
bootstrap 

load _variable found inside scss folder

-----------------------------------------------------
Node and SASS run independently
ei -> load only button or jumbotron or caintainers
