NOTES ON JS METHODS
===================

.APPLY and .CALL: 
	.apply() takes elements out of array passed in second 
parameter and passes them as parameter to the function, so in 
your examples when .apply(null, [3,6,8]) actually calls the 
method as in sumArr(3,6,8). So the correct way to pass 
the parameters would be like sumArr.apply(null, [[3,6,8]]. 
So your code snippet would look like/.

	Typically you'd only use apply or call if you want to 
set (this) for the called function.

	The .apply() method is for passing in an array to a 
function as individual arguments, so sumArr.apply(null, x) 
here is essentially equivalent to sumArr(3, 6, 8).

	The value 3 doesn't have a length property, so your loop 
never begins.

	If you want to pass parameters as themselves, 
you can use .call()
